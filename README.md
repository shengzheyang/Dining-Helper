## Background

<div width="100">
In our daily life, we often come across a trivial but annoying question: What should we eat?<br /><br />
This is the question we ask almost every time we hang out with our friends. Can we solve this problem in an elegant way with the help of technology?<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

## Basic Features
- A front-end polling panel page which visualizes all voting options.
- Everyone can add new options but can’t edit or delete existing options except for the option’s owner. Multiple choice is enabled. 

## Advanced Features
- Users can input their own available times for the meal.
- Users can search restaurants in an integrated map and pick their desired restaurant on the dropdown menu.

## Recommendation Algorithm
- Rank all mentioned restaurants according to the votes collected so far.
- Rank these restaurants given their distances to the users. (The closer the distance, the higher its rank)
- Give out the mutual available time of all users in the group.
It would be much easier for users to decide given these information.

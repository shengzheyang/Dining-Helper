A chat extension for Facebook Messenger to help a group of people decide where to eat.

## Basic Features
- A front-end polling panel page which visualizes all voting options.
- Everyone can add new options but can’t edit or delete existing options except for the option’s owner. Multiple choice is enabled. 

## Advanced Features
- Users can input their own available times for the meal.
- Users can search restaurants in an integrated map and pick their desired restaurant on the dropdown menu.

## Recommendation Algorithm
- Rank all mentioned restaurants according to the votes collected so far.
- Rank these restaurants given their distances to the users. (The closer the distance, the higher its rank)
- Give out the mutual available time of all users in the group.
It would be much easier for users to decide given these information.
